# 42-Docker

The aim of the Docker-1 project is to make you handle docker and docker-machine, the bases to understand the idea of containerization of services. You can see this project as
an initiation.

## 1. How to Docker (00_how_to_docker):
In this first part you will be introduced to Docker and its main options

## 2. Dockerfiles (01_dockerfiles):
Docker makes it possible to create yourself OWN containers for your OWN applications!  Dockerfiles use a specific syntax that reuses a base image or an existing container to add your own dependencies and your own files.

## 3. Bonus (02_bonus):
Now we can create our future work environments, such as:
* Python
* Golang
* C
